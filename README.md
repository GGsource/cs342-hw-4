You will chose one of the following design patterns: Template Method, Proxy, Adapter or Abstract Factory. Using the Maven JavaFX Project template in the sample code section of our BB course page, you will write a JavaFX program that highlights the functionality of the design pattern you chose. This does not need to be a lot of code and the GUI does not need to be extensive. You can not simply copy and paste an example from the web. You must also include a single page describing how the design pattern works in your program and what the benefits and/or drawbacks of using it are. Format this page as a PDF.
