Sources are saying on September 19th of 2023 a little red homonculus will come down from the sky during the first presidential debate of the 2024 election and spit on both of the leading party candidates. For some unknown reason the crowd will find this universally hilarious and a cult following will subsequently form around this creature. By election day this extraterrestrial spitter will be polling ahead of both candidates combined and go on to win the presidential race. He will mysteriously evaporate during inauguration, and the nation will be heartbroken. The creature's vice president will go on to lead for an incredibly unremarkable 4 years, but "Spitter 2024" will forever be brought up in political debates from then on. Copy-cat politicians will attempt to capitalize on the undying admiration for the spitter from beyond, but none will ever be successful in this endeavor.
